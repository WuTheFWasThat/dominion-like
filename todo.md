infra:
  - make it so you can export/load the whole log
  - put git commit hash somewhere (in error msgs?)

ENGINE
- having cards go in play, and be discarded when you reboot?
  - then vps can cost 0 energy

CARDS
- give +$1 per discard (too good b/c of reboot?)
- Rats
    description: '+1 card, trash a card from your hand besides Rats. Gain a Rats. If trashed, +1 card.',
- recycle (trash, gain money = energy cost?)
- trash a card from your discard pile
- event that upgrades reboot (+1 card)?

- gambit:
  0 energy
  draw 2 cards.  if either is an estate, gain 3 vp.  otherwise, gain 1 energy

- bad situations:
  - if you have 6 cards in hand, you cannot draw more cards
  - if you draw up to 10 cards in hand, gain a copper
  - every 10 energy, set $ to 0?
- windfall: if your deck and discard are empty, gain 4 golds.  trash this

- a card that when discarded gets trashed?  (even to reboot so you have to always play it)

- clones a card in hand?
- borrow: get $1 money now, -1 card or something
