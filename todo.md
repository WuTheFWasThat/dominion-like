- add initial state setup?
  - implement card that gives N VP after playing N times
  - implement card that gives N VP if N cards in hand
  - implement card that gives N VP if N copies in hand

give +$1 per discard

card that draws +1 card each time it's played

make it so you can export/load the whole log

put git commit hash somewhere (in error msgs?)

Rats
  description: '+1 card, trash a card from your hand besides Rats. Gain a Rats. If trashed, +1 card.',

recycle (lose energy = energy cost)

idea: play a card and trash it

trash a card from your discard pile

having cards go in play, and be discarded when you reboot?
  - then vps can cost 0 energy

event that upgrades reboot (+1 card)?

probabilistic cards
gambit:
  0 energy
  draw 2 cards.  if either is an estate, gain 3 vp.  otherwise, gain 1 energy

duke:
  + vp equal to number of duchies in deck

bad situations:
  - if you have 6 cards in hand, you cannot draw more cards
  - for every 10 cards you draw, gain a copper

good situations
  - conservation: whenever you trash a card, +1 vp

- a card that when discarded gets trashed?  (even to reboot so you have to always play it)
