infra:
  - make it so you can export/load the whole log
  - put git commit hash somewhere (in error msgs?)
  - make it so you dont need to confirm clicks so much

ENGINE
- having cards go in play, and be discarded when you reboot?
  - then vps can cost 0 energy

CARDS
- Rats
    description: '+1 card, trash a card from your hand besides Rats. Gain a Rats. If trashed, +1 card.',
- recycle (trash, gain money = energy cost?)
- trash a card from your discard pile

- gambit:
  0 energy
  draw 2 cards.  if either is an estate, gain 3 vp.  otherwise, gain 1 energy

- bad situations:
  - if you have 6 cards in hand, you cannot draw more cards
  - if you draw up to 10 cards in hand, gain a copper
  - every 10 energy, set $ to 0?
- windfall: if your deck and discard are empty, gain 4 golds

- a card that when discarded gets trashed?  (even to reboot so you have to always play it)

- borrow: get $1 money now, -1 card or something

- more cards that give money
  - gives you money based on VP you have

positive situations that you have to buy (expensive in terms of energy)
  - every 5 energy spent, draw 5 cards
  - every 10th card played costs 0 energy
  - after reboot, cards cost 1 less energy until you draw a card
  - reboot reduces $ by 2, doesn't remove it
  - give +$1 per discard (too good b/c of reboot?)

make an in-play area...
OR
paul's idea: draw doesn't reshuffle, only reboot can

- gain money equal to energy?
- time eater: every 12 cards played, gain an energy
- awakened: each turn, gain energy = number of situations
- runic pyramid, unceasing top

- something like bullet time
